            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <h2>My name is Stephanie Jarrett.</h2>
            <p>I have been playing the Violin since I was 7 years old. At the time
                that I
                began, I studied for a few years with Jenny Wadsworth and then following her instruction for a
                few
                more
                years with the late Jeanne Grover. I finished my studies through High School with Karen Child.
                Karen
                was
                able to take my ability to perform to places I never thought were possible. Even now I still
                look
                back
                in
                awe at what I was able to do!</p>

            <p>I started teaching In 2015 when I was just shy of 21 years old. I started my teaching journey by
                helping
                out
                a couple of my cousins with their school music and what I thought at the time was just a side
                job/hobby
                turned into something I have a genuine love for!

                In the last year I have found a new love in playing the Viola! I started teaching myself back in the
                summer
                of 2022. A lot about learning the viola came naturally to me except for having to learn how to read
                Alto
                Clef! Since then, it has been such a fun experience to learn the different techniques the Viola
                requires
                compared to the Violin.

                I currently play with the Davis County Celebration Orchestra as a Violist and have been loving the
                experiences and joy I receive when performing with such a fun group!</p>
